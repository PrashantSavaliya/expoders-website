Selecting a language that is easy to implement will help ensure faster implementation times and reduce maintenance costs in the long run. Popular choices include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP etc. It also helps if you incorporate popular frameworks like Angular or React for better performance of the application.</span>
                        <span>Incorporating interactive elements into your system such as video chat sessions or whiteboard sessions not only makes learning more efficient, but also keeps users engaged and ensures high retention rates. Additionally, incorporating features like adapted assessments or personalized feedback allows educators to customize content according to individual student needs leading to better understanding of material being taught leading in turn to improved results.</span>
                        <span>Finally, with remote learning becoming commonplace due to Covid-19 and lockdown restrictions, it is essential that access control protocols are put into place along with encryption algorithms so that data being shared between users remains secure. Furthermore, authentication methods should be incorporated into the system via 2FA (two-factor authentication) or OTPs (one time passwords). This not only adds an extra layer of security, but also adds credibility and builds trust with customers.</span>
