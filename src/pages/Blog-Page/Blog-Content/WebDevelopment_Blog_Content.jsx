                        Web development encompasses the tasks involved in developing websites for the internet or an intranet. It ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. Here's a detailed description of web development:
                        <span>Web development involves several disciplines, including web design, front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. These disciplines work together to create interactive, user-friendly, and functional websites and web applications.</span>
                        <span>Web Design:
                            <br />Web design focuses on the aesthetic aspects of a website, including layout, colors, typography, and graphical elements. Web designers use design tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or Figma to create mockups and wireframes of web pages before they are developed.
                        </span>
                        <span>Front-End Development:
                            <br />Front-end development involves building the client-side of a website or web application, which users interact with directly. Front-end developers use languages such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. They also work with front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to streamline development and enhance user experience.
                        </span>
                        <span>Back-End Development:
                            <br />Back-end development focuses on the server-side of a website or web application, which handles data storage, retrieval, and processing. Back-end developers use server-side languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, or Java, along with frameworks such as Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, or Spring Boot, to build server-side logic and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). They also work with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store and manage data.
                        </span>
                        <span>Full-Stack Development:
                            <br />Full-stack development involves working on both the front-end and back-end of a website or web application. Full-stack developers have expertise in both client-side and server-side development, allowing them to build complete and scalable web solutions. They are proficient in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and databases, enabling them to work on all aspects of web development.
                        </span>
                        <span>Technologies and Tools:
                            <br />Web developers use a variety of technologies, tools, and platforms to develop websites and web applications. Some commonly used technologies include:
